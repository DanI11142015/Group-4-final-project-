# Group-4-final-project

**Project 4- Proposal**


We wanted to train a ML model to predict patients disease when symptoms were entered. 

We used 3 models best for classifaction method SVC, NB, and Random classifer. 

We gathered our data from a kaggle dataset. 

Our model was trained and efficently to 100% using 3 models succesfully against a training and testing dataset and successfully predicting disease.
