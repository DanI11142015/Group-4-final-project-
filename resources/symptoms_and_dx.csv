It may also include significant behavioral changes lasting at least a month and of ongoing worry about the implications or concern about having other attacks. The latter are called anticipatory attacks (DSM-IVR). Panic disorder is not the same as agoraphobia (fear of public places),although many afflicted with panic disorder also suffer from agoraphobia. Panic attacks cannot be predicted,therefore an individual may become stressed,anxious or worried wondering when the next panic attack will occur. Panic disorder may be differentiated as a medical condition,or chemical imbalance. The DSM-IV-TR describes panic disorder and anxiety differently. Whereas anxiety is preceded by chronic stressors which build to reactions of moderate intensity that can last for days,weeks or months,panic attacks are acute events triggered by a sudden,out-of-the-blue cause: duration is short and symptoms are more intense. Panic attacks can occur in children,as well as adults. Panic in young people may be particularly distressing because children tend to have less insight about what is happening,and parents are also likely to experience distress when attacks occur.

Two common ones are: Strabismus – a disorder in which the two eyes don’t line up in the same direction. This results in “crossed eyes” or “walleye.” Nystagmus – fast,uncontrollable movements of the eyes,sometimes called “dancing eyes” Some eye movement disorders are present at birth.

Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are the most common specific forms in the United Kingdom. Other types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified. Bulimia nervosa is a disorder characterized by binge eating and purging. Purging can include self-induce vomiting,over-exercising,and the usage of diuretics,enemas,and laxatives. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by extreme food restriction to the point of self-starvation and excessive weight loss. Though primarily thought of as affecting females (an estimated 5–10 million being affected in the U.K.),eating disorders affect males as well. An estimated 10 – 15% of people with eating disorders are males (Gorgan,1999). (an estimated 1 million U.K. males being affected). Although eating disorders are increasing all over the world among both men and women,there is evidence to suggest that it is women in the Western world who are at the highest risk of developing them and the degree of westernization increases the risk. Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating disorder. The skill to comprehend the central processes of appetite has increased tremendously since leptin was discovered,and the skill to observe the functions of the brain as well. Interactions between motivational,homeostatic and self-regulatory control processes are involved in eating behaviour,which is a key component in eating disorders.

Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight,create distinctive facial stigmata,damage neurons and brain structures,which can result in psychological or behavioral problems,and cause other physical damage. The main effect of FAS is permanent central nervous system damage,especially to the brain. Developing brain cells and structures can be malformed or have development interrupted by prenatal alcohol exposure; this can create an array of primary cognitive and functional disabilities (including poor memory,attention deficits,impulsive behavior,and poor cause-effect reasoning) as well as secondary disabilities (for example,predispositions to mental health problems and drug addiction).

The disease is spread via the fecal-oral route through contaminated food and water,and is primarily a food borne disease. After ingestion the eggs pass through the lumen of the intestine into the tissues and migrate preferentially to the brain and muscles. There they form cysts that can persist for years. In some cases the cysts will eventually cause an inflammatory reaction presenting as painful nodules in the muscles and seizures when the cysts are located in the brain. Symptomatic disease from Taenia solium cysts in the brain is referred to as neurocysticercosis and is the most common tapeworm infection of the brain worldwide. Cysticercosis should be differentiated from taeniasis: carriage of the adult tapeworm in the intestine (which is through ingestion of cysts in an intermediate host,not the ingestion of the eggs as in cysticercosis). These represent two different stages of the parasite’s life cycle. Though both forms of infection can potentially occur in the same individual at the same time,they are distinct disease entities and have different treatments and potential outcomes.

Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes. A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia. Several causes are known,with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitosis. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (CBC),but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia. The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic,in which the factor lies outside of the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia,which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line. Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition,though in idiopathic eosinophilia,the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids. Eosinophilia is not a disorder,unless it is idiopathic.

The ICP gradually falls but still maintains a slightly elevated level and the CSF pressure reaches a high normal level of 150 to 200 mmH2O. Measurements of ICP,therefore,are not usually elevated. Because of this equilibration,patients do not exhibit the classic signs that accompany increased intracranial pressure such as headache,nausea,vomiting,or altered consciousness,although some studies have shown pressure elevations to occur intermittently. However,the enlarged ventricles put increased pressure on the adjacent cortical tissue and cause myriad effects in the patient. The classic symptom triad (gait disturbance,urinary incontinence,and dementia or mental decline) was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965. NPH is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease,Alzheimer's disease,or dementia,due to its chronic nature and nonspecific presenting symptoms . Although the exact mechanism is unknown,normal-pressure hydrocephalus is thought to be a form of communicating hydrocephalus with impaired CSF reabsorption at the arachnoid granulations.

It is caused by infestation of the parasitic roundworm Enterobius vermicularis,commonly called the human pinworm. Infection usually occurs through the ingestion of pinworm eggs,either through contaminated hands,food,or less commonly,water. The chief symptom is itching in the anal area. The incubation time from ingestion of eggs to the first appearance of new eggs around the anus is 4 to 6 weeks. Pinworms are usually considered a nuisance rather than a serious disease. Treatment is straightforward in uncomplicated cases,however,elimination of the parasite from a family group or institution often poses significant problems—either due to an incomplete cure or reinfection.

Contractions are called positive myoclonus; relaxations are called negative myoclonus. The most common time for people to encounter them is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk),"but myoclonic jerks are also a sign of a number of neurological disorders. Hiccups are also a kind of myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm. When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a ""provoked spasm"".

If a woman keeps having miscarriages,it is also called infertility. Female infertility can result from physical problems,hormone problems,and lifestyle or environmental factors. Most cases of infertility in women result from problems with producing eggs. One problem is premature ovarian failure,in which the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause. In another,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or may not release a healthy egg. About a third of the time,infertility is because of a problem with the woman. One third of the time,it is a problem with the man. Sometimes no cause can be found. If you suspect you are infertile,see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause,treatments may include medicines,surgery,or assisted reproductive technologies. Happily,two-thirds of couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.

Pernicious anemia,if left untreated,is usually fatal within three years. Once identified,however,the condition can be treated successfully and with relative ease,although it cannot be cured and ongoing treatment is required. Humans obtain almost all of their vitamin B12 from dietary means. Pernicious anemia is usually the result of insufficient secretion of intrinsic factor within the stomach.

Panic attacks usually begin abruptly,may reach a peak within 10 minutes,but may continue for much longer if the sufferer had the attack triggered by a situation from which they are not able to escape. In panic attacks that continue unabated,and are triggered by a situation from which the sufferer desires to escape,some sufferers may make frantic efforts to escape,which may be violent if others attempt to contain the sufferer. Some panic attacks can subside on their own over the next several hours. Often,those afflicted will experience significant anticipatory anxiety and limited symptom attacks in between attacks,in situations where attacks have previously occurred. The effects of a panic attack vary. Some,notably first-time sufferers,may call for emergency services. Many who experience a panic attack,mostly for the first time,fear they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown. Experiencing a panic attack has been said to be one of the most intensely frightening,upsetting,and uncomfortable experiences of a person's life and may take days to initially recover from. Repeated panic attacks are considered a symptom of panic disorder. Screening tools like Panic Disorder Severity Scale can be used to detect possible cases of disorder,and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment.

During normal fetal development,cells from the neural crest migrate into the large intestine (colon) to form the networks of nerves called Auerbach's plexus and Meissner's plexus. In Hirschprung's disease,the migration is not complete and part of the colon lacks these nerve bodies that regulate the activity of the colon. The affected segment of the colon cannot contract and therefore pass stool through the colon,creating an obstruction. In most affected people,the disorder affects the part of the colon that is nearest the anus. In rare cases,the lack of nerve bodies involves more of the colon. In five percent of cases,the entire colon is affected. Stomach and esophagus may be affected too. Hirschsprung's disease is also sometimes called congenital aganglionic megacolon.

The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg,although varicose veins can occur elsewhere. Veins have leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde flow or reflux). Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart (the calf muscle pump mechanism),against the effects of gravity. When veins become varicose,the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly,and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more. Varicose veins are most common in the superficial veins of the legs,which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem,varicose veins can be painful,especially when standing. Severe long-standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling,venous eczema,skin thickening (lipodermatosclerosis) and ulceration. Life-threatening complications are uncommon.

There are two types of kidney cysts. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) runs in families. In PKD,the cysts take the place of the normal tissue. They enlarge the kidneys and make them work poorly,leading to kidney failure. When PKD causes kidneys to fail—which usually happens after many years—people need dialysis or kidney transplantation. About half of people with the most common type of PKD end up with kidney failure. PKD also causes cysts in other parts of the body,such as the liver. Symptoms of PKD include Pain in the back and lower sides Headaches Urinary tract infections Blood in the urine Doctors diagnose PKD with imaging tests and family history. Treatments include medications,and,when people with PKD develop kidney failure,dialysis or kidney transplants. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) usually happens in people who are on dialysis. Unlike PKD,the kidneys are normal sized,and cysts do not form in other parts of the body. People with ACKD already have chronic kidney disease when they develop cysts. ACKD often has no symptoms. In most cases,the cysts are harmless and do not need treatment.

This flavivirus is found in temperate and tropical regions of the world. It was first identified in the West Nile subregion in the East African nation of Uganda in 1937. Prior to the mid-1990s,WNV disease occurred only sporadically and was considered a minor risk for humans,until an outbreak in Algeria in 1994,with cases of WNV-caused encephalitis,and the first large outbreak in Romania in 1996,with a high number of cases with neuroinvasive disease. WNV has now spread globally,with the first case in the Western Hemisphere being identified in New York City in 1999; over the next 5 years,the virus spread across the continental United States,north into Canada,and southward into the Caribbean Islands and Latin America. WNV also spread to Europe,beyond the Mediterranean Basin . WNV is now considered to be an endemic pathogen in Africa,Asia,Australia,the Middle East,Europe and in the United States,which in 2012 has experienced one of its worst epidemics. In 2012,WNV killed 286 people in the United States,with the state of Texas being hard hit by this virus,making the year the deadliest on record for the United States.

Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold,especially in the hands.

Anxiety is feeling unrealistic fear,worry,and uneasiness,usually generalized and unfocused. It is often accompanied by restlessness,fatigue,problems in concentration,and muscular tension. Anxiety is not considered to be a normal reaction to a perceived stressor although many feel it occasionally.

It is a type of electrolyte disturbance. In the blood,about half of all calcium is bound to proteins such as serum albumin,but it is the unbound,or ionized,calcium that the body regulates. If a person has abnormal levels of blood proteins,then the plasma calcium may be inaccurate. The ionized calcium level is considered more clinically accurate in this case. In the setting of low serum albumin (frequently seen in patients with chronic diseases,hepatic disease or even long term hospitalization),the formula for corrected calcium is: Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 - serum albumin ),where 4.0 represents the average albumin level in g/dL; in SI units: Corrected calcium (mmol/L) = measured total Ca (mmol/L) + 0.02 (40 - serum albumin ),where 40 represents the average albumin level in g/L.

It is common in poorer countries but rarely seen in more developed countries that are wealthier. Night blindness is one of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency.

Approximately 250,000 to 500,000 malnourished children in the developing world go blind each year from a deficiency of vitamin A,approximately half of whom die within a year of becoming blind. The United Nations Special Session on Children in 2002 set the elimination of vitamin A deficiency by 2010. The prevalence of night blindness due to vitamin A deficiency is also high among pregnant women in many developing countries.

The first rib is rarely fractured because of its protected position behind the clavicle (collarbone). However,if it is broken,serious damage can occur to the brachial plexus of nerves and the subclavian vessels. Fractures of the first and second ribs may be more likely to be associated with head and facial injuries than other rib fractures. The middle ribs are the ones most commonly fractured. Fractures usually occur from direct blows or from indirect crushing injuries. The weakest part of a rib is just anterior to its angle,but a fracture can occur anywhere. The most commonly fractured ribs are the 7th and 10th. A lower rib fracture has the complication of potentially injuring the diaphragm,which could result in a diaphragmatic hernia. Rib fractures are usually quite painful because the ribs have to move to allow for breathing. When several ribs are broken in several places a flail chest results,and the detached bone sections will move separately from the rest of the chest.

If demineralization exceeds saliva and other remineralization factors such as from calcium and fluoridated toothpastes,these hard tissues progressively break down,producing dental caries (cavities,holes in the teeth).

Head and neck cancers often spread to the lymph nodes of the neck,and this is often the first (and sometimes only) sign of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Head and neck cancer is strongly associated with certain environmental and lifestyle risk factors,including tobacco smoking,alcohol consumption,UV light,particular chemicals used in certain workplaces,and certain strains of viruses,such as human papillomavirus. These cancers are frequently aggressive in their biologic behavior; patients with these types of cancer are at a higher risk of developing another cancer in the head and neck area. Head and neck cancer is highly curable if detected early,usually with some form of surgery,but radiation therapy may also play an important role,while chemotherapy is often ineffective.

While there are several definitions of hypertensive heart disease in the medical literature,the term is most widely used in the context of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding categories. The definition in the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) includes heart failure and other cardiac complications of hypertension when a causal relationship between the heart disease and hypertension is stated or implied on the death certificate. According to ICD-10,hypertensive heart disease (I11),and its subcategories: hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0) and hypertensive heart disease without heart failure (I11.9) are distinguished from chronic rheumatic heart diseases (I05-I09),other forms of heart disease (I30-I52) and ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25).

Like gray hair and wrinkles,presbyopia is a symptom caused by the natural course of aging. The first signs of presbyopia – eyestrain,difficulty seeing in dim light,problems focusing on small objects and/or fine print – are usually first noticed between the ages of 40 and 50. The ability to focus on near objects declines throughout life,from an accommodation of about 20 dioptres (ability to focus at 50 mm away) in a child,to 10 dioptres at age 25 (100 mm),and levels off at 0.5 to 1 dioptre at age 60 (ability to focus down to 1–2 meters only). The expected,maximum,and minimum amplitudes of accommodation for a corrected patient of a given age can be determined using Hofstetter's formulas: Expected amplitude (D) = 18.5 - 0.3 x (age in years),Maximum amplitude (D) = 25 - 0.4 x (age in years),Minimum amplitude (D) = 15 - 0.25 x (age in years).

Connective tissue is any type of biological tissue with an extensive extracellular matrix that supports,binds together,and protects organs. These tissues form a framework,or matrix,for the body,and are composed of two major structural protein molecules: collagen and elastin. There are many different types of collagen protein in each of the body's tissues. Elastin has the capability of stretching and returning to its original length—like a spring or rubber band. Elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues that attach bone to bone) and skin. In patients with connective tissue disease,it is common for collagen and elastin to become injured by inflammation. Many connective tissue diseases feature abnormal immune system activity with inflammation in tissues as a result of an immune system that is directed against one's own body tissues (autoimmunity).

None of these fall under the term conventional weapons which are primarily effective due to their destructive potential. Chemical warfare does not depend upon explosive force to achieve an objective. Rather it depends upon the unique properties of the chemical agent weaponized. A lethal agent is designed to injure or incapacitate the enemy",or deny unhindered use of a particular area of terrain. Defoliants are used to quickly kill vegetation and deny its use for cover and concealment. It can also be used against agriculture and livestock to promote hunger and starvation. With proper protective equipment,training,and decontamination measures,the primary effects of chemical weapons can be overcome.

It is characterized by intense fear in social situations,causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some parts of daily life. The diagnosis of social anxiety disorder can be of a specific disorder (when only specific social situations are feared) or a generalized disorder. Generalized social anxiety disorder typically involves a persistent,intense,chronic fear of being judged by others and of being embarrassed or humiliated by one's own actions. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others. While the fear of social interaction may be recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable,overcoming it can be quite difficult. Social anxiety disorder is known to appear at an early age in most cases. 50% of those who develop this disorder have developed it by the age of 11 and 80% have developed it by age 20. This early age of onset may lead to people with social anxiety disorder being particularly vulnerable to depressive illnesses,drug abuse and other psychological conflicts. Physical symptoms often accompanying social anxiety disorder include excessive blushing,sweating (hyperhidrosis),trembling,palpitations and nausea. Stammering may be present,along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. An early diagnosis may help minimize the symptoms and the development of additional problems,such as depression. Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common for sufferers of social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion,especially if they are undiagnosed,untreated,or both; this can lead to alcoholism,eating disorders or other kinds of substance abuse.

Münchausen syndrome,a severe form of factitious disorder,was the first kind identified,and was for a period the umbrella term for all such disorders. People with this condition may produce symptoms by contaminating urine samples,taking hallucinogens,injecting themselves with bacteria to produce infections,and other similar behaviour. They might be motivated to perpetrate factitious disorders either as a patient or by proxy as a caregiver to gain any variety of benefits including attention,nurturance,sympathy,and leniency that are seen as not obtainable any other way.

Sometimes gastritis develops after major surgery,traumatic injury,burns,or severe infections. Gastritis may also occur in those who have had weight loss surgery resulting in the banding or reconstruction of the digestive tract. Chronic causes are infection with bacteria,primarily Helicobacter pylori,chronic bile reflux,and stress; certain autoimmune disorders can cause gastritis as well. The most common symptom is abdominal upset or pain. Other symptoms are indigestion,abdominal bloating,nausea,and vomiting and pernicious anemia. Some may have a feeling of fullness or burning in the upper abdomen. A gastroscopy,blood test,complete blood count test,or a stool test may be used to diagnose gastritis. Treatment includes taking antacids or other medicines,such as proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics,and avoiding hot or spicy foods.

The PNS nerves connect your brain and spinal cord with the rest of your body. Damage to these nerves makes it hard for them to transmit signals. As a result,your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. No one knows what causes the syndrome. Sometimes it is triggered by an infection,surgery or a vaccination. The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases,you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening.

This can occur either because each cell contains a full extra copy of chromosome 13 (a disorder known as trisomy 13 or trisomy D),or because each cell contains an extra partial copy of the chromosome (i.e.,Robertsonian translocation) or because of mosaic Patau syndrome. Full trisomy 13 is caused by nondisjunction of chromosomes during meiosis (the mosaic form is caused by nondisjunction during mitosis). The extra genetic material from chromosome 13 disrupts the normal course of development,causing multiple and complex organ defects. Like all nondisjunction conditions (such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome),the risk of this syndrome in the offspring increases with maternal age at pregnancy,with about 31 years being the average. Patau syndrome affects somewhere between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 21,700 live births.

It is caused by a DNA poxvirus called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). MCV has no nonhuman-animal reservoir (infecting only humans). There are four types of MCV,MCV-1 to -4; MCV-1 is the most prevalent and MCV-2 is seen usually in adults. The virus that causes molluscum is spread from person to person by touching the affected skin. The virus may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it,such as a towel,clothing,or toys. Once someone has the virus,the bumps can spread to other parts of their body by touching or scratching a bump and then touching another part of the body. Molluscum can be spread from one person to another by sexual contact. This common viral disease has a higher incidence in children,sexually active adults,and those who are immunodeficient,and the infection is most common in children aged one to ten years old. MC can affect any area of the skin but is most common on the trunk of the body,arms,groin,and legs. It is spread through direct contact or shared items such as clothing or towels. There is evidence that molluscum infections have globally been on the rise since 1966,but these infections are not routinely monitored because they are seldom serious and routinely disappear without treatment. The virus commonly spreads through skin-to-skin contact. This includes sexual contact or touching or scratching the bumps and then touching the skin. Handling objects that have the virus on them (fomites),such as a towel,can also result in infection. The virus can spread from one part of the body to another or to other people. The virus can be spread among children at day care or at school. Molluscum contagiosum is contagious until the bumps are gone. Some growths may remain for up to 4 years if not treated.
